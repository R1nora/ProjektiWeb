            <p> A business lawyer is an attorney who focuses his or her legal practice on issues that affect businesses, such as taxation, various types of business transactions, and intellectual property. Almost all lawyers work primarily from offices on a full-time basis.
                <br>As the name suggests, a general business lawyer can provide legal advice on a wide range of matters. 
                This type of lawyer has a hand in every legal discipline. 
                If your business doesn’t deal with special circumstances, a general business lawyer may be well suited to your purposes.
                <br>When considering this type of business lawyer, ask questions about various scenarios that could affect your business.
                 If you aren’t confident that your business would be covered in those scenarios, you may want to choose a more specialized lawyer.
                <br> Using an employment and labor lawyer only makes sense when your business has employees. If it does,
                  your business should comply with state and federal laws.
                  An attorney in this area of the law can help you draft employee manuals and ensure safety standards are in place.

                    <p>Every state in this country has laws related to contracts. Tennessee contract law is complex and you should consult with an attorney before
                         signing a contract.
                        <br>The law requires most contracts to have four basic elements: mutual consent, capacity, legality, and consideration. 
                        A contract that does not fulfill all of the requirements under Tennessee contract law may be invalid. 
                        This is one of the main reasons you need an experienced contract attorney to draft and/or review a contract before you sign. 
                        Our contract lawyers provide comprehensive contract services to ensure your contract meets Tennessee law.</p>

                    <p>
                        M&A lawyers assist their clients with the appropriate financing for mergers and acquisitions and provide advice concerning the drafting, 
                        negotiation, and performance of contracts for the sale of portions of the business. 
                        M&A transactions are among the most complex and significant events in the life of a firm— the consequences of which reverberate 
                        both internally and externally.

                 <br>The vast majority of M&A work is done at large and medium firms. Large firms often focus on the buying and selling of public companies.
                 These are generally the biggest and most complex deals, are often cross-border and can involve cash and/or stock considerations. 
                  M&A deals between private companies can also be multifaceted, particularly where partnerships are involved.</p>

                    <p>
                        A general practice attorney or a general practice
                        lawyer is a legal professional with the ability to handle a wide range of legal matters without necessarily being specialized
                        in a specific area of the law.
                        The term “general practice” is used to refer to general areas of the law as opposed to specialized areas of the law
                        For example, a general practice attorney can represent a client in court, handle contract negotiations
                        and provide legal support concerning common legal issues faced by people living in society.
                       <br> General practice lawyers are great to handle the routine and simpler types of cases.
                        Younger lawyers starting their practice will tend to start as a general practice lawyer until they 
                        can find an area of the law that they will consider specializing in.</p>
