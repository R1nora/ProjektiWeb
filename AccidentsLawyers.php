                        Trucks are crucial to the American economy. Unfortunately, because of their size, 
                        they can be deadly or inflict serious harm to other motorists.
                        <br>Large commercial trucks like tractor-trailers, big rigs, or eighteen-wheelers 
                        weigh up to 20 times as much as a passenger car. 
                        Moreover, trucks are considerably larger than a passenger car and may 
                        be carrying up to 80,000 pounds of payload.</p>
